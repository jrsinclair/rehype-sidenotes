                        <p>Your first year of marriage will be hard. Don’t let it take you by surprise. Expect it.
                            Prepare for it. Marriage is hard work, and the first year is when you will work the hardest.
                            It will be tough, but it is an opportunity. An opportunity to man-up and learn what it
                            really means to love someone. So here’s my advice:</p>

                        <p>Take the initiative for reconciliation. Do not wait for her to come to you. Step up and start
                            the conversation. You take responsibility and you sort things out. Jesus didn’t wait around
                            for us to be in a better mood and beg forgiveness before he went to the cross. <em>“But God
                                demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for
                                us.”</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"
                                class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> He took the initiative for reconciliation with us; you
                            take the initiative in reconciling with your wife. Sometimes it may well feel like going to
                            your death. So if you want to love your wife like Christ loved the church,<a href="#fn:2"
                                id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> then this is a good
                            place to start.</p>

                        <p>Be the first to apologise <em>even if it’s mostly her fault.</em> Show some integrity and
                            deal with <em>your</em> sin before bringing up hers. This starts&nbsp;the conversation with
                            humility and patience, rather than&nbsp;anger and self-righteousness.&nbsp;It doesn’t mean
                            letting her walk all over you.&nbsp;It just means triple-checking that you’ve got the
                            telegraph-pole out of your own eye before you tackle the speck in hers.<a href="#fn:3"
                                id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;I’m not saying
                            you should apologise for things that aren’t your fault either. But you <em>will</em> sin
                            against her without realising it. Get good at discovering when you’ve done that, and
                            apologise first.</p>

                        <p>Learn <em>how</em> to apologise. Explain in your own words what you did and why it was wrong.
                            Describe your understanding of how that must have affected her. Say you are sorry. Then
                            listen. Do not make excuses. Do not justify yourself. Most of the time your understanding of
                            how it affected her will be wrong. Stick with it until you actually do understand, <em>and
                                she knows you understand.</em> Do not ask for forgiveness until you’ve reached that
                            point. It will not be quick. It will not be easy. It will hurt. Real apologies are
                            gut-wrenchingly painful. They are also worth it.</p>

                        <p>Don’t let the sun go down on an argument.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"
                                class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> If you’re fighting, don’t let it fester. Take the
                            initiative and sort it out before it turns septic and you have to chop off a limb. People
                            will tell you that sometimes it’s good to give each other space and calm down. This is only
                            good advice when you’re too angry or emotional to have a calm conversation. Don’t use this
                            good advice as an excuse to put off a hard discussion. Agree with each other beforehand that
                            this will be your strategy—you don’t go to bed angry. Then gird your loins, show some
                            courage and talk it through.</p>

                        <p>In summary, have the courage to be humble and put her needs before your own. Learn to do this
                            consistently when you least feel like doing so. This is easy to say and hard to do. It will
                            pay off in the long run though. Through the process you will lay a good foundation for the
                            future, learn a whole lot about your wife, and become a better man.</p>
